      <h2>About Squash at WBHS</h2>

      <h3>Social & Beginner Squash</h3>
      <p>
        At Westlake Boys High School, squash is open to students of all abilities. 
        For beginners, we provide a welcoming social league where you can enjoy a casual hit each week, 
        improve your fitness, and build confidence in a fun environment.
      </p>

      <h3>Development Pathways</h3>
      <p>
        For players aiming to take their squash further, we run a Development Squad. 
        These students train both independently and alongside the Premier Squad, giving them the 
        opportunity to sharpen their skills and progress quickly to the next level.
      </p>

      <h3>Premier Squad </h3>
      <p>
        At the highest level, our Premier Squad offers structured training, 
        strength and conditioning support, and competitive matches against top schools. 
        Many of our Prem players have represented New Zealand, and the program continues 
        to develop future representatives. The Prem program is one of the best programs in NZ and continues to develop  to be better.
